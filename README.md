# sims_on_surfaces
A method of solving differential equations confined to smooth surfaces
This uses Lie Group methods to solve differential equations which are known to be confined to smooth surfaces.
The example used in the simulation was taken from the paper "Quadrature methods based on the Cayley transform" by Marthinsen and Owren
It is shown confined to the surface of a sphere.
the mathematical details are expalained in the accompanying writeup "Julian Christopher MA880 Final Project.pdf"
