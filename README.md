# sims_on_surfaces
A method of solving differential equations confined to smooth surfaces.
The method shown in this example uses Lie Group methods to solve differential equations confined to smooth surfaces.
The example used in the simulation was taken from the paper "Quadrature methods based on the Cayley transform" by Marthinsen and Owren,
it is shown confined to the surface of a sphere.
the mathematical details are expalained in the accompanying writeup "Dynamical System on a Sphere Example.pdf"
